In this assignment you will use test driven development methodology to create the program as discussed below.
Follow TDD, don't write any code unless a failing test demands it. Write minimum code to make tests pass. Start early and take very small steps. 
Keep your tests passing at all times. Keep the design lightweight and the code quality high.

Problem statement:
Implement an application that will perform the following actions:
1.	Prompt the user and read in value for the year of their birth (e.g. 1994)
2.	Prompt the user and read in a value for the month of their birth(e.g. 2 for February)
3.	Prompt the user and read in a value for the day of their birth (e.g. 14).
4.	Print out the day of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday) on which that day falls for year.
	e.g. "You were born on a Sunday"

Deliverables:
1. Provide Software Design Document (SDD). Template is provided at class website.
2. Complete working Code with TDD transition and sample output.
